Visualize how gradients relate to surfaces
The Points (x, y, z) satisfying w = f (x, y, z) = u x^2 + v y^2 + z^2 for a particular value of w form the the surface shown. As the w varies, the surface deforms along the normals defined by the vector field 
gradient f = f_x i + f_y j + f_z k
represented by the arrows.
